# **Traffic Sign Classifier Project** 



The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the informational index (see underneath for connections to the task informational collection) 

* Investigate, outline and envision the informational collection 

* Configuration, prepare and test a model design 

* Utilize the model to make predictions/forecasts on new pictures 

* Investigate the softmax probabilities of the new pictures 

* Abridge the outcomes with a composed report


### Reflection

### 1. Data Set Summary & Exploration
I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43
