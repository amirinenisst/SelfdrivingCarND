# **Traffic Sign Classifier Project** 



The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the informational index (see underneath for connections to the task informational collection) 

*Investigate, outline and envision the informational collection 

*Configuration, prepare and test a model design 

*Utilize the model to make predictions/forecasts on new pictures 

*Investigate the softmax probabilities of the new pictures 

*Abridge the outcomes with a composed report

### Reflection

### 1. My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First step includes data Set Summary & Exploration. Secondly, exploratory visualization of the dataset is 
done. The next part included designing and testing the model Architecture. Last but not the least I included test model on new images.
